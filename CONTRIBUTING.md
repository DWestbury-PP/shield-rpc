# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project follows Conventional Commits and aims for a friendly, welcoming contributor experience.

## How to contribute
- Check open issues and discussions; comment if you want to take one.
- For larger changes, open an issue first to discuss design.
- Fork and create a feature branch from `main`.
- Write clear commits using Conventional Commits, e.g. `feat: add protected routing fallback`.
- Add tests if relevant and update docs.
- Open a PR, fill in the template, link related issues.

## Development
- If `package.json` exists: `npm ci` then `npm run dev` / `npm test`.
- If `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` exists: create a venv, install deps, run tests.

## Code style
- Keep functions small and readable. Prefer explicit names.
- Add basic logging and input validation.
